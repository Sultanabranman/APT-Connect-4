/**
 * This requirement requires you to understand a little more about pointers.
 * We want you to understand that all pointers just point to another memory
 * address whether they are a single pointer, a pointer to a pointer, etc.
 * 
 * In this example, we want you to swap the pointers for two players. 
 * This will be called from \ref play_game with a call such as 
 * swap(&current, &other) and at the end of this function, current and
 * other's pointers will be swapped.
 * For example, if current points to the human player and other points to 
 * the computer player, at the end of this function, the player they point 
 * to will have been swapped. 
 * 
 * @param current the current player who has just completed their turn
 * @param other the next player whose turn it will be
 **/

	/* creates temporary player struct to store current player*/
    struct player tmp;

/**
 * This is the heart of the game.
 * 
 * Firstly, you need to initialise the game by calling functions written 
 * for requirement 3. The rest of this function is then managing the game 
 * loop.
 *
 * Each player takes a turn to drop a token into a column on the game 
 * board. The task that needs to be performed will be different depending 
 * on whether this is a human or a computer player.
 *
 * Regardless of the player type, you will need to display the board as it 
 * was before the player makes their move. If the current player is a 
 * computer player, we just need to select a column at random and drop a
 * token into that column. If there is no room, try another column.
 *
 * If the current player is a human player, your program will need to ask 
 * the user what column they wish to drop a token in. This input should be 
 * validated to check that it is numeric and within the range of allowed 
 * columns.
 * 
 * Once a valid move has been entered, your program should update the 
 * gameboard. It should then check if the game has been won lost or drawn 
 * by calling and the change the current player.
 *
 * This function also checks if the game has been won, lost or drawn by 
 * calling \ref test_for_winner(), and if the game is over, returns the 
 * winner to main or NULL if the game was a draw.

 * @param human a pointer to details about the human player
 * @param computer a pointer to details about the computer player

 * In this requirement you are required to test what the game's current

 *    G_DRAW,
 *    G_RED,
 *    G_WHITE
 * };
 *
 * Most of these states should be self-explanatory but let's go through 
 * their meaning.
 * 
 *    &bull; G_NO_WINNER: the game is still in progress and therefore there
 *    is no winner yet.
 * 
 *    &bull; G_DRAW: neither player has won the game but there are no more 
 *    spaces left for a player to make a move.
 *    
 *    &bull; G_RED / G_WHITE: the player whose token is the specified 
 *    colour has won the game.
 *
 * Your task in this function is to iterate over the 2-dimensional array 
 * (the board) looking for four in a row in any direction â€“ if you find 
 * this, return the appropriate value of either G_RED or G_WHITE.
 *
 * Next, test for a draw. If none of these cases hold, return G_NO_WINNER.
